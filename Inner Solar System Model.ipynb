    "## Objective\n",
    "This project creates a physically accurate mathematical model and subsequent interactive animations of the orbits of the inner solar system. I started with position and velocity data from the NASA JPL horizons system and applied Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation in a way that represents the orbital mechanics. This resulted in both a 2D animated video and a fully interactive 3D model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills Demonstrated\n",
    "**Programming:** Python\n",
    "**Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly\n",
    "**Techniques:** N-Body Simulation, Numerical Integration (Leapfrog), 2D/3D Animation, Data Sourcing (NASA JPL), Scientific Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sourcing\n",
    "Initial position and velocity vectors of the inner solar system planets and the sun were obtained from [NASA's JPL website](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/) using the starting time of January 1, 2024 at 00:00."

    "## Simulation Method\n",
    "After calculating the acceleration using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation between each body and summing them up into the accelerations vector, I used Leapfrog integration to calculate the positions at each time step and stored them in a positions_history array. I chose this method due to its excellent long-term stability in orbital mechanics problems. As a symplectic integrator, it excels at conserving the total energy of the system which prevents the orbits from spiraling out of control in the short time of this simulation. The positions_history array provided me with the data points required to run the 2D and 3D representations."
